# randomChoiceCompare.js
Selecting a given choice, compare that with a randomly selected choice.

Using the built-in object Math, I use the Math.random() method to randomly generate a number between 0 - 1,
assign a choice to a number depending on the amount of choices within the project, 
and tests to see whether you have chosen the same choice with variations such as winning and losing.

To test this code, I have chosen a simple coin flip example, 
where if the number is less than .5 it will select "heads" if else it will select "tails" and compare this with your selection.

I created a seperate branch to demonstrate this code but using more variation in the form of rock, paper, scissors. 

This code has been simplified with the use of ternary conditionals, 
setting rules as a variable, and creating an array of choices for the eventlisteners.
